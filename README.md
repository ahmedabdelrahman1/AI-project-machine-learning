Introduction
Spam messages have become a significant issue in our daily communication. This project aims to develop an efficient SMS spam detection system using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to create a model that can accurately identify and classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the models is a curated collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (non-spam). The dataset is divided into a training set and a testing set to evaluate the performance of the models accurately.

Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms were implemented in this project:

Decision Trees (DT): A tree-like model that makes decisions based on multiple conditions.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): A supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis.

Naive Bayes: A probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem and the assumption of independence among features.

k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric method used for classification and regression tasks.

Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification that uses the logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.

Installation
To run the SMS spam detection system on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ahmedabdelrahman1/AI-project-machine-learning.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset and place it in the data directory.

Usage
Execute the main script to train the models and evaluate their performance:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Results
The results of the SMS spam detection system will be displayed, showing the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for each algorithm.
